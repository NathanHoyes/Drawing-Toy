## About
Python drawing application made using Tkinter.

Doesn't support drawing in the typical sense, more for visualisations of equations and such.

## Goals
- Refactor a spirograph drawing app I made for Uni to a much higher standard
- Drawing of Euler's Triangle based on 3 points chosen by the user
- Draw cool geometric spirals I saw someone do on Reddit over a decade ago and haven't seen since.
